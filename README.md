# Polyp Detection — Cross-Modal Architecture Comparison

**Which YOLO architecture generalizes best across endoscopic imaging modalities?**

> PolypDB · 4-Architecture Comparison · Trained on WLI → Zero-shot tested on NBI / BLI / FICE / LCI

---

## The Research Question

PolypDB contains 5 imaging modalities: WLI, NBI, BLI, FICE, and LCI.  
WLI (White Light Imaging) accounts for 3,588 of 3,934 images (91%).

> **Does architecture choice — independent of augmentation — affect how well a WLI-trained model generalizes to unseen imaging modalities?**

This study trains four architectures under identical conditions (same dataset, epochs, augmentation config) where **only the model architecture varies**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Larger is not more generalizable

YOLO26s achieves the same WLI performance as others (98.3%) but the worst OOD generalization — dropping to 76.1% on BLI and 79.0% on NBI.

YOLOv11s (similar parameter count) outperforms it on every OOD modality by **6–18 percentage points**.

| Model | WLI → BLI drop | WLI → NBI drop |
|---|---|---|
| YOLO26s | **−22.2%** | **−19.3%** |
| YOLOv11n | −5.6% | −4.8% |
| YOLOv11s | −4.3% | −3.9% |
| YOLOv8n | −5.0% | −5.7% |

YOLO26s has **4–5× larger cross-modal drop** than the v11/v8 architectures.

### 2. YOLOv11s achieves best overall balance

- Best average OOD mAP@50: **95.9%**
- Highest single OOD score: LCI **99.2%**
- Most consistent across all 5 modalities

### 3. YOLOv8n punches above its weight

3.01M parameters vs 9.41M for YOLOv11s — yet achieves **95.3% average OOD**. Strong generalization at 1/3 the model size.

### 4. Cross-modal drop order is consistent across all architectures

**LCI > FICE > NBI > BLI** — this reflects domain shift magnitude, not architecture behavior.

## Why the Cross-Modal Gaps Exist

**LCI generalizes best** — Linked Color Imaging preserves the white-light color profile. Closest color statistics to WLI.

**NBI and BLI drop significantly** — Narrow-band imaging uses 415nm / 540nm wavelengths to highlight vascular patterns, producing fundamentally different color distributions.

**FICE sits in between** — Post-processing simulation of narrow-band contrast with partial WLI color overlap.

**Clinical implication:** A WLI-only model is reliable for standard imaging and LCI, but should not be deployed for NBI/BLI without additional adaptation. The gap is not a model failure — it is a real domain boundary.

## Training Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Training modality | WLI only |
| Dataset split | 70 / 15 / 15 (train / val / test) |
| Epochs | 100 |
| Image size | 640px |
| Augmentation | HSV enabled (hsv_h=0.015, hsv_s=0.7, hsv_v=0.4), spatial flips, mixup |
| Hardware | Kaggle T4 GPU |

**HSV augmentation rationale:** Standard YOLO HSV values (hsv_s=0.7, hsv_v=0.4) were kept to introduce color variance during training. The hypothesis was that exposing the model to a wider range of color conditions would help it generalize across modalities with different color profiles. Note: พี่ฟิล์ม's baseline used HSV=0 (locked) based on the reasoning that tissue color carries diagnostic signal — comparing these two approaches is a natural next experiment.
